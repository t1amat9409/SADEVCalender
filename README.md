# SADEVCalender React.Component
Nothing much here, I created this around June last year, when I first heard of [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/).

## Usage

```javascript
  import SADEVCalender from './SADEVCalender' //or any path to SADEVCalender
  /* ..... Some other code/imports here */
  
  //Use it, please note this componet will take 100vw x 100vh of your device. Basically fullscreen.
  //But you can edit it however you may want, my job is done here
  <SADEVCalender />
```

So yup, I created this project, just experimenting with [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/), but now I use it every now and then, I almost ran out of sandboxes to create.

### THE END!!!!
